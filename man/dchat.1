.SH NAME
dchat \- P2P Client
.SH SYNOPSIS
dchat <INT> <LPORT> <NICK> [<DST> <RPORT>]

.SH DESCRIPTION
DChat is a chat client which utilizes peer to peer techniques in order to establish a decentral network of chat clients. For that purpose the DChat protocol is used which is based on HTTP. A detailed description of how the DChat protocol works, can be found in the file called "PROTOCOL"
  
This DChat client provides an in-chat command interpreter for convenient commands like connecting to other DChat clients, listing of current contacts, and a lot more. Commands supported by this client can be found in the manpage in the section "Commands" ( see: dchat(1) )

Since DChat is based on a decentral network, no central server is required. Therefore as long as there are clients within the network the network will live. This means that, if implemented properly, the DChat protocol takes care for exchanging contact information between clients accross the network automatically. No user interaction is necessary.
