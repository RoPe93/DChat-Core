                          DChat - P2P Client

 BASIC INSTALLATION
 ------------------

Follow the steps below to compile and install DChat:

 1. `cd` to the directory containing the dchat source code and type
    `./configure` to configure dchat for your system.  If you're
    using `csh` on an old version of System V, you might need to type
    `sh ./configure` instead to prevent `csh` from trying to execute
    `configure` itself.
     
    If for whatever reason other options for configuration are required,
    type `./configure --help` to display a list of configurable options
    and their descriptions.
 
    Running `configure` takes some time.  While running, it prints some
    messages telling which features it is checking for.
 
 2. Run `make`. This will build the dchat source code into an executable 
    program (or programs) and may take a few minutes, depending on the
    speed of the computer and the size of the package. 

 3. Run `make install`. This will install the compiled binaries, the 
    documentation and configuration in the appropriate directories.

 4. You can remove the created object files from the build directory by 
    typing `make clean`.  To also remove the files that `configure` 
    created (so you can compile dchat for a different kind of computer),
    type `make distclean'.
