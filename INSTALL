                          DChat - Peer-To-Peer Chat over TOR 

  BASIC INSTALLATION
  ------------------

    Follow the steps below to compile and install DChat:

     1. `cd` to the directory containing the dchat source code and type
        `./configure` to configure dchat for your system.  If you're
        using `csh` on an old version of System V, you might need to type
        `sh ./configure` instead to prevent `csh` from trying to execute
        `configure` itself.
         
        If for whatever reason other options for configuration are required,
        type `./configure --help` to display a list of configurable options
        and their descriptions.
     
        Running `configure` takes some time.  While running, it prints some
        messages telling which features it is checking for.
     
     2. Run `make`. This will build the dchat source code into an executable 
        program (or programs) and may take a few minutes, depending on the
        speed of the computer and the size of the package. 

     3. Run `make install`. This will install the compiled binaries, the 
        documentation and configuration in the appropriate directories.

     4. You can remove the created object files from the build directory by 
        typing `make clean`.  To also remove the files that `configure` 
        created (so you can compile dchat for a different kind of computer),
        type `make distclean'.  


  FIRST USAGE
  -----------

  Follow the steps below if you use DChat the first time:

     1. Configure a hidden-service whose onion-id and hidden port can be 
        used for the client. Follow this link for a step-by-step tutorial:
        <http://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-hidden-service.html.en>
        
        If you start the DChat client you have to specify the generated 
        onion-id and the hidden port of this local hidden service in order
        to chat with other users.  
     
     2. Start TOR by using the GUI or by running `tor` within the CLI. 

     3. Run `dchat -s <ONIONID> -n <NICKNAME> -l <LOCALPORT>`.  If you start 
        the DChat client you have to specify the generated onion-id and the 
        hidden port of this local hidden service in order to chat with other
        users.  

        DChat will listen on this hidden port and will wait for connections
        from remote hosts. If someone connects, the specified onion-id will 
        be sent to the newly connected host. 

        Make sure you start DChat with the correct onion-id, otherwise chatting
        with other users will not work as expected!
