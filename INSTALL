 INSTALLATION
 ------------

Follow the steps below to install DChat:

1) Run the ./configure script in the untarred source archive's 
top-level directory with whatever command line arguments you need. 
The options that configure recognizes are usually contained in a 
file called README.
 
2) Run make. This will build the source code into an executable 
program (or programs) and may take a few minutes or a few hours, 
depending on the speed of the computer and the size of the 
package. 

3) Run make install. This will install the compiled binaries, 
configuration files, and any libraries in the appropriate 
directories.
