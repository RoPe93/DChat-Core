                          DChat - P2P Client

2014-06-22:
    When option `-r / --rport` but no option `-d / --dest` has 
    been specified, DChat will use the local listening ip address
    of the client and the remote port specified with `-r / --rport` 
    for connection.

2014-06-21:
    Fixed bug that caused the client to execute the termination
    signal handler twice and therefore print "Good Bye" two times.
    User prompt is now colored yellow, while text messages from
    other users will be colored cyan.

2014-06-20:
    DChat is now supporting short and long options using getopt.
    Available options can be found in the manpage.
