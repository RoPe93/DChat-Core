                          DChat - P2P Client

2014-06-21:
    Fixed bug that caused the client to execute the termination
    signal handler twice and therefore print "Good Bye" two times.
    User prompt is now colored yellow, while text messages from
    other users will be colored cyan.

2014-06-20:
    DChat is now supporting short and long options using getopt.
    Available options can be found in the manpage.
