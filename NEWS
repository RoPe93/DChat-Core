                          DChat - Peer-To-Peer Chat over TOR 

    2014-06-22:
        Huge changes have been applied to DChat. The protocol has been
        redesigned completely and will now only work within the TOR
        network for anonymously chatting. DChat now requires a hidden
        service to be configured first to accept connection requests 
        from the TOR network. Therefore the TOR package is required and 
        needs to be installed beforehand. More infomation on that topic
        can be found in the INSTALL file and in the man page of dchat.

    2014-06-22:
        When option `-r / --rport` but no option `-d / --dest` has 
        been specified, DChat will use the local listening ip address
        of the client and the remote port specified with `-r / --rport` 
        for connection.

    2014-06-21:
        Fixed bug that caused the client to execute the termination
        signal handler twice and therefore print "Good Bye" two times.
        User prompt is now colored yellow, while text messages from
        other users will be colored cyan.

    2014-06-20:
        DChat is now supporting short and long options using getopt.
        Available options can be found in the manpage.
