                          DChat - P2P Client

  What is it?
  -----------
  
  DChat is a chat client which utilizes peer to peer techniques in order 
  to establish a decentral network of chat clients. For that purpose the
  DChat protocol is used which is based on HTTP. A detailed description
  of how the DChat protocol works, can be found in the file called 
  "PROTOCOL"
  
  This DChat client provides an in-chat command interpreter for convenient
  commands like connecting to other DChat clients, listing of current 
  contacts, and a lot more. Commands supported by this client can be found
  in the manpage in the section "Commands" ( see: dchat(1) )

  Since DChat is based on a decentral network, no central server is 
  required. Therefore as long as there are clients within the network
  the network will live. This means that, if implemented properly, the 
  DChat protocol takes care for exchanging contact information between
  clients accross the network automatically. No user interaction is
  necessary.
